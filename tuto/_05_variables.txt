collinion is in C syntax, and like any programming language, you can use varibles as memory.

There is several types, and we should use only integers, and floats sometime.

Variables must be declared between "ALGO" and the switch(), 
That permits a more flexible code and can save some calculation if your conde is too heavy:
instead of calculate every time NB_AROUND(alive) for each statement, we can save it in a variable and reuse it !

int	< var_name > ;
	=> declare an integer (0, 1, 2 ... up to 2147483647)
float	< var_name > ;
	=> declare a float (0.1, 99999.66666 ...)

feel free to use them and discover a new game_of_life syntax in example/_05_var_and_switch.c

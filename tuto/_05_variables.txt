Collinion is in C syntax, and like any programming language, you can use variables as memory.

There are several types, and we should use only integers, and sometimes floats.

Variables must be declared between "ALGO" and the switch function. 
That allows a more flexible code and can save some calculation:
Instead of calculating every time NB_AROUND(alive) for each statement, we can save it in a variable and reuse it !

int	<var_name> ;
	=> declares an integer (0, 1, 2 ... up to 2147483647)
float	<var_name> ;
	=> declares a float (0.1, 99999.66666 ...)

Feel free to use them and discover a new game_of_life syntax in:

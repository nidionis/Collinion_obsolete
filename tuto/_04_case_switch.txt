Now you grown up, and you should know something:
"switch" is more powerfull than you think, and we were using only the default statement but we should write:

switch(CELL) {
        case (cell_type1):
		[ actions1 ] ;
                break;
        case (cell_type2):
		[ actions2 ] ;
                break;
	default:
		[ actions3 ] ;
		break;
}

DO NOT FORGET TO "break ;" AT THE END OF EACH CASE

You don't need to verify if 'CELL == cell_type' every time and your code will be lighter

Try to modify your game of life if you like ;)

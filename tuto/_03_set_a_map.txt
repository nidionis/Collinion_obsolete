Do you get bored of random maps you cannot handle ?

run_collinion takes a map file as its second argument, and scales the pixels with the screen size (you can change these values in the config.h file)

Try 
	./run_collinion game_of_life.c examples/_03_map.txt
		and enjoy a pixel kissing

The map is a text file, containing one pixel per character.
The first cell_type is '0', the second is '1' and so on...

The map MUST be a rectangle and the surrounding cell frame (i.e. the outer line of numbers in the matrix) will never be modified.
It means you can use "external" cell patterns that won't be modified.

If you just need a basic (surrounding ?) wall, you can use a letter you will not use : 'z' is far away enough.
You can even make a labyrinth, and who knows what idea you can have

If you want to use more than 10 cell_types, or hack the program attributing values to your cell (yes you can), you need to know : the values are affected to the matrix following the ASCII tab
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII)
Basically, after '8' and '9' comes ':' ';' '<' '=' '>' '?' '@' 'A' 'B' 'C' .... (in terminal: man ascii)


Just in case:
	You can use ".." to reach the parent folder
		cd ..
	If you are in the tutorial folder, you can use:
		../run_collinion ../game_of_life.c ../example/_03_map.txt

	And 'tab' completes the filenames, and list the folder.

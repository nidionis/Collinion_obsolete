You get bored of random map you cannot handle ?

run_collinion take a map file as second argument, and will scale the pixels with the screen size (you can change these values in the config.h file)

Try 
	./run_collinion game_of_life.c examples/_03_map.txt
		and enjoy a pixel kissing

The map is a text file, containing one pixel per character.
The first cell_type is '0', the second is '1' and so on...

The map MUST be a rectangle (sorry about that ?) and the surrounding cell will never be modified, you can appreciate that as cells generator patterns, depending of your rules :)

If you just need a basic (surrounding ?) wall, you can use a letter you will not use : 'z' is far away enough
You can even make a labyrinth, and who knows what idea you can have

If you want to use more than 10 cell_types, or hack the program attributing values to your cell (yes you can), you need to know : the values are affected to the matrix following the ASCII tab
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII)
Basicly, after '8' and '9' comes ':' ';' '<' '=' '>' '?' '@' 'A' 'B' 'C' ....


Just in case:
	You can use ".." to reach the parent folder
		cd ..
	If you are in the tutorial folder, can use
		../run_collinion ../game_of_life.c ../example/_03_map.txt

	And 'tab' autocompete the filename and can even be used as ls
	Maybe you can appreciate the terminal thanks to Tab

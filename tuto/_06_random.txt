rand() is a function taken from C language.

It returns a random number, from 0 to an high value (at least 32767, check "man 3 rand")

Let's say your cells make children and you want them randomly male or female, the trick is using the modulo operator (what is left in a division)

3 % 2 = 1
4 % 2 = 0
5 % 2 = 1 ....

if (rand() % 2 == 0) {
	NEW_CELL = male ;
} else {
	NEW_CELL = female ;
}

If you define male and female at the top of cell's declaration (them value are 0 and 1), you can even write:

NEW_CELL = rand() % 2 ;

If you defined them anywhere else, but female (or male) next to male (or female):

NEW_CELL = (rand() % 2) + male ;
(or:	NEW_CELL = (rand() % 2) + female ; )

Have fun with this new tool !

Welcome to collinion universe

I guess you can't wait for a try, you can execute a file using "./" in front of it
try in  terminal: 
	./run_collinion

But run_collinion is waiting for one (or two) argument !
Try and enjoy:
	./run_collinion game_of_life.c

	|+| NoOb_n0te:
	|+| From a terminal check where you are using "pwd"
	|+| change your directory using "cd"
	|+| list the directory using "ls"
	|+| ex:
	|+| > pwd
	|+| 	/home/my_home
	|+| > ls
	|+| 	collinion  Desktop  Downloads 
	|+| > cd collinion
	|+| > pwd
	|+| 	/home/my_home/collinion
	|+| > ls
	|+| 	examples	README.md	tuto
	|+| 	game_of_life.c	program		run_collinion
	|+| then ./run_collinion game_of_life.c should work
	|+| 
	|+| At least, use a graphical interface,
	|*| jump in the collinion folder
	|*| click->right select "open in teminal" and finally:
	|*| 	./run_collinion game_of_life.c

Waaaaaaaa, beautyfull isn'it ?
run_collinion use the algo written in the .c file (in C syntaxe) and execute any algo you can create !

Let's check this file 
you can use any text editor as gedit, nano, vim...
write:
	gedit game_of_life
	(or right-click and open with gedit)

There is 3 main parths in a collinion file:
	- the cell declaration
	- the color setting
	- the algo[s]

	#################################
DECLARING A TYPE:
Just write (or copy/paste)
	DEFINE_TYPE: <a_type> ; (the type must finish by ";")

	note: the actual value of a type will be
		0 for the first
		1 for the second
		and so on ...

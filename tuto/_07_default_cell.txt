If you want to define a default cell (like: any cell_type above 1 is infected) you can :
- attribute a default color using DEFAULT_COLOR as :
	CELL_COLOR[DEFAULT_COLOR] = <a_color> ;
- not declare the cell_type;
- refresh the default type with the "default:" switch rule.

Notice that the WALL value is a part of default cell.
It's time to change its value from the 'config.h' file because -1 can be buggy ! (maybe #DEFINE WALL 0 ?)

	-----------------------------------------

By the way, programming languages allow you to use some loop statements, a cool one is the "for" loop:

https://www.w3schools.com/c/c_for_loop.php

for ( <start_declaration> ; <end_condition> ; <refresh_statement>) {
	< loop_actions >
}

example :

int	i_max = 3;
int	I_will_be_multiplied_by_1000 = rand() ;

for (int i = 0; i < i_max; i += 1) {
	I_will_be_multiplied_by_1000 *= 10 ;	
}

And a cool thing in C syntax:

					a =  a + 1;	
can be written		a += 1;
and even			a++;
or					++a;

In the last case, the value of a will be increment with the hihest priority, if you want to know more:

Check how cool is the Belousov algo in the examples, and feel free to play with the values.

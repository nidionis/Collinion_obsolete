A prime algo ? What for ?

Our program "switch" any cell into a new one and refresh the picture with the new matrix.
Maybe you would love give priority to some rules !

Using PRIME_ALGO is the way to do that.
It works exactly the same way of ALGO, and ALGO will refresh the matrix produced by PRIME_ALGO

Let's try to implement a gravity to our game of life !
And why not : lets give priority to gravity

How would you do that ?
(I consider each alive drop one pixel each refresh)

Open game_of_life, copy-paste between PRIME_ALGO and END_ALGO tags:

switch(CELL) {
	default:
		/* put your rules here */
	break;
}

You can find an answer in the file example/_01_gravity_game_of_life.c

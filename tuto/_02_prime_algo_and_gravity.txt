A PRIME_ALGO ? What for ?

Our program "switches" any cell to a new one and updates the picture with the new matrix.
Maybe you would love to give priority to some rules !

Using PRIME_ALGO is the way to do that.
It works exactly in the same way of ALGO, and ALGO will update the matrix produced by PRIME_ALGO.

Let's try to implement gravity in our game of life !
And why not : let's give priority to gravity

How would you do that ?
(I consider each living cell ("alive") drops by one pixel each update)

Open game_of_life, copy-paste between PRIME_ALGO and END_ALGO tags:

switch(CELL) {
	default:
		/* put your rules here */
	break;
}

You can find an answer in the file example/_01_gravity_game_of_life.c
